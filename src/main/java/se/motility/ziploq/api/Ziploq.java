/**
 * A device for synchronizing and sequencing messages from any number of input sources.
 * <p>
 * Each input source has to be individually registered with this device and configured
 * according to its nature. Both sources providing ordered and unordered data are
 * supported. See {@link #registerOrdered} and {@link #registerUnordered} for more information.
 * <p>
 * {@code Ziploq} relies on a global business clock. All messages are sequenced with respect to
 * the this business clock, with the possibility of providing a {@code Comparator} to resolve
 * ordering of any ties.
 * <p>
 * For unordered input sources the parameter <i>business delay</i> defines the upper bound on how
 * <i>late</i> messages may arrive in relation to other messages from the same source. In
 * particular, if an unordered source is configured with business delay {@code x} and the highest
 * business timestamp for a processed message so far is {@code tsMax}, the contract states that
 * only new messages having business timestamp {@code tsMax - x} or higher will be sequenced
 * correctly.
 * <p>
 * There are three methods for retrieving sequenced messages from this device; {@link #stream},
 * {@link #take} and {@link #poll}. For normal data processing purposes, building data pipelines
 * with {@code stream()} is encouraged.
 * <p>
 * The synchronization mechanism supports backpressure on both producer and consumer side. See
 * {@link BackPressureStrategy} for more information.
