/**
 * A device for synchronizing and sequencing messages from any number of input sources.
 * <p>
 * Each input source has to be individually registered with this device and configured
 * according to its nature. Both sources providing ordered and unordered data are
 * supported. See {@link #registerOrdered} and {@link #registerUnordered} for more information.
 * <p>
 * {@code Ziploq} uses a two-clock system; the first clock being the <i>business
 * clock</i> and the second the <i>system clock</i> (wall-clock time). These two clocks are
 * assumed to be shared by all data sources (or at least not drifting outside the configured
 * safety-margin). All messages are sequenced with respect to the business clock, with the
 * possibility of providing a {@code Comparator} to resolve ordering of any ties. The system
 * clock is used to allow advancing the sequence at times when input sources are silent.
 * There are two parameters associated with message sequencing; <i>business delay</i> and
 * <i>system delay</i>.
 * <p>
 * Business delay is specified for unordered input sources and defines the upper bound on how
 * <i>late</i> messages may arrive in relation to other messages from the same source. In
 * particular, if an unordered source is configured with business delay {@code x} and the highest
 * business timestamp for a processed message so far is {@code tsMax}, the contract states that
 * only new messages having business timestamp {@code tsMax - x} or higher will be sequenced
 * correctly.
 * <p>
 * System delay specifies how much system time must pass until messages may be emitted at times
 * when input sources are silent. The {@code global system time} is defined by the input source
 * that has the lowest current system time. This guarantees that all input sources are up-to-date
 * and healthy (although potentially silent message-wise) before advancing the message sequence.
 * More formally; if one or more sources are silent, messages having a system timestamp higher
 * than {@code global system time + system delay} may be emitted. The system delay must be set to
 * a value higher than any configured business delay of registered unordered sources.
 * <p>
 * There are three methods for retrieving synchronized messages from this device; {@link #stream},
 * {@link #take} and {@link #poll}. For normal data processing purposes, building data pipelines
 * with {@code stream()} is encouraged.
 * <p>
 * The synchronization mechanism supports backpressure on both producer and consumer side. See
 * {@link BackPressureStrategy} for more information.
