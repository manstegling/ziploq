 * The output side of Ziploq, i.e. an interface for retrieving the synchronized

 * There are three methods for retrieving sequenced messages from this device; {@link #stream},
 * {@link #take} and {@link #poll}. For normal data processing purposes, building data pipelines
 * with {@code stream()} is encouraged.
 * <p>
 * For the ability to register input sources use {@link Ziploq} or {@link ZipFlow}
 * as provided by the {@link ZiploqFactory}. For automatic threading and scheduling use
 * {@link ZiploqFactory#managedZiploqBuilder} or {@link ZiploqFactory#managedZipFlowBuilder}, respectively.
